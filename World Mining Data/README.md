#### Data Visualization (Power BI)

I will provide an overview of data visualization conducted using Power BI. I focused on analyzing and visualizing our database and mining data to gain insights into customer names, quantities over years, price and profit comparison by material type and service, as well as quantity by months. The report also includes details about delay reasons and profit targets.
*	Customer Analysis:
Matrix visualizes customer names based on quantities over the years, providing a comprehensive understanding of customer trends and their order quantities.
*	Price and Profit Comparison:
A line chart presents a comparison of prices and profits by material type and service. This visualization helps identify trends and patterns in terms of pricing and profitability.
*	Monthly Quantity Analysis:
The line chart on this page illustrates the quantity of mining services provided on a monthly basis. This allows for tracking performance and identifying any seasonality or fluctuations in demand.
*	Delay Reason Analysis:
The pie chart showcases the distribution of delay reasons in our process. This visualization provides insights into the most common reasons for delays,
*	Profit Targets:
This section presents the profit targets set for our company. It includes a comparison between actual profits achieved and the set targets, providing an assessment of project performance against financial goals.

Having successfully implemented Power BI for our database, we are now eager to examine data visualization using the World Mining Data (WMD). Through this report, we will present a clear narrative and empower decision-makers and stakeholders with actionable insights for the future.
*	Global Mineral Production Trend: Create a line chart showing the trend of total world production of minerals from 2017 to 2021. This chart will give an overview of how mineral production has changed over the years.
*	Top Mineral Producing Countries: Use a bar chart to display the top mineral-producing countries based on the data
*	Mineral Production by Region : Create a map visualization to display the distribution of mineral production by region. We used geographical regions or continents to group the data and color-code based on the production figures.
*	Mineral Raw Materials Contribution: Use a stacked column chart to showcase the contribution of different mineral raw materials to the total world production from 2017 to 2021. 
*	Political Stability and Mineral Production: Use a pie chart or a map to show how political stability varies among different countries and how it may impact their mineral production.
*	Mineral Production of Individual Countries on a World Map: Plot the mineral production of individual countries on a world map using geospatial visualization to see which countries are significant producers and where they are located.
 
 

#### Final implementation of Visualization (Power BI):
I have finally total 6 dashboards in order to follow up company and world operation data.
*	2 dashboards for VanPetro Database
*	4 dashboards for World Mining Data

Once satisfied with the Power BI dashboard in Power BI Desktop, I published it to the Power BI Service. This is a cloud-based platform that allows you to share your dashboard with others, collaborate, and access the dashboard from anywhere. In Power BI Service, we can share a dashboard with specific users or groups. I can also embed the dashboard in websites, blogs, or other applications using an embed code

Since employees of our company use Microsoft Teams a lot and they are familiar with it. Embedding a Power BI dashboard or report into Microsoft Teams is a great way to provide easy access to data for our team members.
